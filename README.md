This little script written for a raspberry pi helps you:
Keep an eye on your WiFi clients and enable your charging station only if a certain MAC address is logged in.
Keep an eye on a pushbutton to switch off the charger and turn on an outlet for e defined amount of time.
Count pulses from a power meter to know consumption.
Check when the power was consumed to know the tariff.
Add a markup if you want to sell juice.
Have a mini-webserver showing the monthly consumptions.

This is far from finished, but it works decently.

Prerequisites to run it:
- Know how to set up a service 
- How to set up a wifi hotspot
- Basic networking
